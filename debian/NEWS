python-ucam-webauth (0.9.0-1) bionic; urgency=medium

  The raven Python package is now named ucam_webauth.raven.  Code will need
  updating to use the new package name.

  The Debian package has also been renamed from python-raven to
  python-ucam-webauth.

  Another, completely unrelated, Python module called raven and packaged as
  python-raven is now present in the Debian and Ubuntu archives.

python-raven (0.7-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  Since python-raven 0.7, code which uses the Flask decorator must be updated
  to either set request.trusted_hosts, or to pass can_trust_request_host=True
  if the web server validates the Host and X-Forwarded-Host HTTP headers
  provided by the client.

  Failure to do so will now break authentication.

  This is an important security feature to prevent the replay by a malicious
  third party of authentication responses intended for another website.
